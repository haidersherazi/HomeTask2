Give answers on the following the tasks:

1) What class and method would you use to read a few pieces of data that are at known positions near the end of a large file?

You can use the RandomAccessFile class to read data from known positions near the end of a large file. The seek() method can be used to position the file pointer at a specific location, and then you can read the data using the read() method.

2) When invoking format, what is the best way to indicate a new line?

We can use %n to indicate a new line. This is a platform-independent way to insert a newline character.

3) How would you determine the MIME type of a file?

To determine the MIME type of a file in Java, you can use the Files.probeContentType() method from the java.nio.file package.

4) What method(s) would you use to determine whether a file is a symbolic link?

To determine whether a file is a symbolic link, you can use the Files.isSymbolicLink() method.
